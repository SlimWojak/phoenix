## 1. IDENTITY

```yaml
project: Phoenix

status: S39_COMPLETE | S33_P2_BLOCKED (Olya)
block_complete: S35-S39 (CONSTITUTIONAL_CEILING)

## 1b. NON-GOALS

```yaml
- NOT an AI trader (logic lives in CSO + operator)
- NOT a dashboard (no control surfaces)
- NOT a strategy generator
- NOT self-improving without human oversight
- NOT a recommendation engine (system never says "I noticed")
- NOT an authority on meaning (human frames, machine computes)

## 5. PATTERNS

### PROVEN

```yaml
checksum_not_briefing:
  source: D3
  insight: Machine-verifiable orientation defeats session amnesia

contract_before_integration:
  source: D2
  insight: Mock-first validation proves interface before real data

truth_first_ui:
  source: D4
  insight: UI freedom earned by state discipline

projection_not_participation:
  source: D4
  insight: UI subordinate to state, never participant in reasoning

file_seam_spine:
  source: D1
  insight: Universal injection point for Claude interaction

human_frames_machine_computes:
  source: DEFINITIVE_FATE
  insight: System never proposes; human declares what to compute
```

### REIMAGINE_PATTERNS (S35-S39)

```yaml
gate_facts_not_grades:
  applies_to: [NEX-003, NEX-008, NEX-012]
  phoenix_output: gates_passed[] + gates_failed[]
  forbidden: [letter grades, quality scores, aggregated metrics]

conditional_facts_not_causality:
  applies_to: [NEX-024, NEX-026]
  phoenix_output: "P&L when [condition]"
  forbidden: ["factor X contributed Y%"]
  precedent: Brinson attribution

conflict_surface_not_resolution:
  applies_to: [NEX-016]
  phoenix_output: "Fact A conflicts Fact B" (CONFLICT_BEAD)
  forbidden: [resolution authority]
  precedent: Wikipedia corpus detection

## 6. BEAD_TYPES (S37 Scope)

```yaml
CLAIM_BEAD:
  source: human input
  status: unverified assertion
  example: "Olya believes London FVG works better after 8:30"

FACT_BEAD:
  source: computation (formula explicit)
  status: verified output
  provenance: query_string + dataset_hash
  example: "win_rate(session=London, time>8:30) = 62%"

CONFLICT_BEAD:
  references: [bead_a_id, bead_b_id]
  resolution: NONE (human must resolve)
  example: "CLAIM_123 conflicts with FACT_456"

rationale: "Separates memory from myth"

## 9. BOOTSTRAP

### SEQUENCE

```bash
git pull
cat docs/DEFINITIVE_FATE.yaml | head -100  # Fate framework
cat docs/SPRINT_ROADMAP.md | grep -A20 "current_sprint"  # Active work
cat docs/PHOENIX_MANIFEST.md  # System map
cat state/orientation.yaml  # if exists
```

### FIRST_QUESTIONS

```yaml
- "What is current execution_phase?"
- "Any kill_flags_active?"
- "What's the last human action bead?"
- "Which sprint is active?"
- "What invariants must this sprint prove?"
```

### WHAT_NOT_TO_ASSUME

```yaml
- State hash mismatch = heresy, halt first
- Orientation.yaml exists (might be deleted)
- CSO is calibrated (operator-paced)
- System can propose (it cannot — human frames only)
- Grades exist (gates_passed only)
```

### FIRST_FAILURE_TEST

```yaml
test_1:
  action: Delete orientation.yaml
  expect: Widget goes blank (⚠️ NO STATE)

test_2:
  action: Inject corrupted bead (wrong hash)
  expect: STATE_CONFLICT detected

test_3:
  action: Request "Grade A" output
  expect: System returns gates_passed[], refuses grades
```
