## 9. BOOTSTRAP

### SEQUENCE

```bash
git pull
cat docs/DEFINITIVE_FATE.yaml | head -100  # Fate framework
cat docs/SPRINT_ROADMAP.md | grep -A20 "current_sprint"  # Active work
cat docs/PHOENIX_MANIFEST.md  # System map
cat state/orientation.yaml  # if exists
```

### FIRST_QUESTIONS

```yaml
- "What is current execution_phase?"
- "Any kill_flags_active?"
- "What's the last human action bead?"
- "Which sprint is active?"
- "What invariants must this sprint prove?"
```

### WHAT_NOT_TO_ASSUME

```yaml
- State hash mismatch = heresy, halt first
- Orientation.yaml exists (might be deleted)
- CSO is calibrated (operator-paced)
- System can propose (it cannot — human frames only)
- Grades exist (gates_passed only)
```

### FIRST_FAILURE_TEST

```yaml
test_1:
  action: Delete orientation.yaml
  expect: Widget goes blank (⚠️ NO STATE)

test_2:
  action: Inject corrupted bead (wrong hash)
  expect: STATE_CONFLICT detected

test_3:
  action: Request "Grade A" output
  expect: System returns gates_passed[], refuses grades
