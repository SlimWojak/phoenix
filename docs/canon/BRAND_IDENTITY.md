# a8ra — BRAND IDENTITY

```yaml
document: BRAND_IDENTITY
version: 1.0
date: 2026-02-09
status: CANONICAL

```

---

## 2. DOMAINS & PRESENCE

```yaml
domains:
  a8ra.com:
    status: LIVE
    purpose: "Brand presence — autonomous art installation"
    operation: "Picasso Forge generates, curates, publishes"
    maintenance: None required unless broken

  a8ra.ai:
    status: RESERVED
    purpose: "Future product/API surface"
    timing: Post v0.1

social:
  x_handle: "@a8ra_ai"
  purpose: "Auto-publish from Picasso Forge, brand mystique"

code:
  github_current: "Private repos (echopeso org)"
  github_future: "Consolidate under a8ra org (post v0.1)"
```

---

## 3. MYTHOLOGY — THE NINE DOMAINS

```yaml
description: |
  Nine symbolic domains that map to system architecture.
  Mythology appears in website themes, can inform internal naming.

domains:

  HIVE:
    symbol: "Swarm coordination"
    maps_to: "Mission Control — multi-office orchestration"

  DEXTER:
    symbol: "R&D Lab"
    maps_to: "Evidence refinery — extraction, hypothesis testing"

  ORACLE:
    symbol: "Strategy Office"
    maps_to: "CSO — domain knowledge, methodology validation"

  BUNNY:
    symbol: "Chaos testing"
    maps_to: "Adversarial validation, CHAOS_BUNNY invariant tests"

  MEMBRANE:
    symbol: "Governance layer"
    maps_to: "Constitutional ceiling, invariants, halt override"

  INFINITY:
    symbol: "Continuous compounding"
    maps_to: "The 8 in a8ra — 24/7 operation, evidence accumulation"

  GAS_TOWN:
    symbol: "Resource management"
    maps_to: "Cost/token budgets, INV-COST-CEILING"

  VORTEX:
    symbol: "Market interface"
    maps_to: "IBKR/execution layer, order flow"

  BIPOLAR:
    symbol: "Regime detection"
    maps_to: "Market state awareness, regime-conditional logic"

usage_note: |
  These are thematic handles for brand storytelling.
  Internal engineering uses Phoenix module names.
  The mythology provides creative latitude without constraining architecture.
```

## 4. NAMING CONVENTIONS

```yaml
public_brand:
  name: "a8ra"
  usage: "External communications, website, social, future products"

internal_codenames:
  trading_system: "Phoenix"
  r_and_d: "Dexter"
  coordination: "Mission Control"
  offices:
    g_sovereign: "G_SOVEREIGN"
    core: "CORE_OFFICE"
    cso: "CSO_OFFICE (Oracle)"
    dexter: "DEXTER_OFFICE"

product_names_future:
  foundry_service: "a8ra Foundry"
  api_surface: "a8ra API"

codebase_naming:
  rule: "Phoenix codename persists in code, comments, internal docs"
  rationale: "Avoid churn — rename brand externally, not codebase internally"

documentation:
  rule: "Add context where Phoenix first appears: 'Phoenix (a8ra trading system)'"
  anti_pattern: "Heavy-handed find/replace Phoenix → a8ra throughout"
```

---

## 5. WEBSITE — AUTONOMOUS ART INSTALLATION

```yaml
purpose: |
  Brand mystique, audience accumulation, pattern validation.
  NOT a product landing page. NOT lead gen.

architecture:
  name: "Picasso Forge"
  repo: "a8ra_web (private)"
  pattern: "Multi-agent autonomous generation"

operation:
  trigger: "404-minute epochs (6.7 hours)"
  generation: "3 sub-agents (VISCERAL, DREAMSCAPE, GEOMETRIC)"
  optionality: "2 candidates per agent (6 total)"
  curation: "Harsh Picasso judgment layer (rejects mediocrity)"
  iteration: "Max 2 curation loops, then fallback"
  delivery: "Auto-commit → auto-deploy → auto-publish to X"

cost: "$5-9/month (Anthropic API + Vercel)"
maintenance: "None required unless broken"

pattern_validation: |
  Picasso Forge is a working prototype of Mission Control pattern:
  - Multi-agent coordination ✓
  - Git-based state ✓
  - Cron-triggered autonomy ✓
  - Bounded iteration (no runaway) ✓
  - Graceful fallback ✓

  See MISSION_CONTROL_DESIGN_v0.1.md Section 15 for mapping.

## 6. BRAND POSITIONING

```yaml
tone:
  - Mysterious
  - Technical
  - Patient
  - Premium

anti_patterns:
  - "Hype" (no moonshot language)
  - "Sign up now" (no urgency manipulation)
  - "AI slop" (no generic AI art aesthetic)
  - "Generic SaaS" (no feature lists, pricing tiers visible)

target_audience:
  - Technical founders
  - Quant-adjacent professionals
  - AI-native builders
  - "People who read CLAUDE.md files"

strategy: |
  Premium by omission.
  Those who get it, get it.
  The website is a filter, not a funnel.

  Audience accumulates passively via:
  - X auto-posts (art generation)
  - Technical content (when ready)
  - Word of mouth from inner circle

no_launch_announcement: |
  a8ra doesn't "launch" — it exists.
  Discovery is earned, not advertised.
```

---

## 7. RELATIONSHIP TO PHOENIX DOCS

```yaml
canonical_chain:
  BRAND_IDENTITY.md: "What is a8ra? (public brand)"
  PHOENIX_MANIFEST.md: "What is Phoenix? (trading system architecture)"
  MISSION_CONTROL_DESIGN.md: "How do offices coordinate? (operations)"
  ENDGAME_VISION.md: "Where is this going? (24/7 refinery)"
  SPRINT_ROADMAP.md: "What are we building now? (execution)"

new_session_orientation:
  read_first: "BRAND_IDENTITY.md (1 min) — understand naming"
  then: "PHOENIX_MANIFEST.md (5 min) — understand architecture"
  then: "Current sprint brief — understand immediate work"

key_insight: |
  a8ra is the umbrella brand.
  Phoenix is the first product (trading system).
  Dexter is the R&D arm.
  Mission Control is the operating model.

  All three operate under a8ra brand externally.
  Internally, codenames persist for engineering clarity.
