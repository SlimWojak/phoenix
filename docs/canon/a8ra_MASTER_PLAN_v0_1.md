# a8ra MASTER PLAN

```yaml
document: a8ra_MASTER_PLAN
version: 0.2
date: 2026-02-22
status: CANONICAL — updated post v0.1 SEAL + Bead Field Gate 1 PASS
purpose: Canonical world view for the a8ra Sovereign Intelligence Refinery
audience: G (strategic), Claude instances (orientation), future engineers (context)
owner: G (Sovereign Operator)
format: M2M_DENSE — every word earns its place
```

## 0. WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

This is the top of the document hierarchy. It answers **why a8ra exists** and **how it operates**. It does not repeat schema definitions or sprint histories — those live in their own canonical documents.

```yaml
DOCUMENT_HIERARCHY:
  MASTER_PLAN: "Why and how" (this document)
  SYSTEM_MANIFEST: "What exists and where" (operational orientation for Claude instances)
  BEAD_FIELD_SPEC: "The data physics" (technical schema constitution)

READING_ORDER:
  new_human: MASTER_PLAN → SYSTEM_MANIFEST → relevant spec
  new_instance: SYSTEM_MANIFEST → office docs → task queue
  G_reference: MASTER_PLAN (owns the vision)
```

---

## 1. IDENTITY

```yaml
NAME: a8ra (pronounced "a-eight-ra")
TYPE: Sovereign Intelligence Refinery
FUNCTION: Systematize discretionary trading expertise into mineable, reproducible knowledge

CORE_LOOP:
  human_frames: "G and Olya define what to look for"
  machine_computes: "Agents scan, extract, test, reject, learn"
  human_promotes: "Olya validates. G approves capital."
  machine_refines: "Dream Cycle mines failures into Skills"

ONE_SENTENCE: |
  a8ra is a multi-generational family office infrastructure that absorbs
  domain expertise, converts it to cryptographically anchored knowledge,
  and mines its own failures to compound edge over time.
```

## 2. THE TWO-ECONOMY MODEL

This is the core architectural insight. Everything else follows from it.

```yaml
ECONOMY_1 — GOVERNANCE (The Law):
  question: "Is this signed, within the lease, and approved?"
  characteristics: Deterministic, binary, state-machine-driven, permanent
  substrate: Phoenix governance beads (17+ types, 1618 tests, 240 chaos vectors)
  hardware: M4 Max (current), M3 Ultra control plane (future)
  examples:
    - LEASE_ACTIVATION_BEAD → lease goes live
    - LEASE_HALT_BEAD → halt fires in <50ms
    - STATE_LOCK_BEAD → hash-verified state transition
    - T2_APPROVAL → human gate for capital
    - CEREMONY_BEAD → weekly attestation
  tempo: Slow, deliberate, high-trust
  rule: "Once signed, it's law."

ECONOMY_2 — ANALYTICAL (The Science):
  question: "What does the system know, and can it learn from what it rejected?"
  characteristics: Rich, bi-temporal, provenance-linked, mineable, experimental
  substrate: Bead Field (8 analytical types, ChadBoar-validated at ~5000 beads/day)
  hardware: M3 Ultra (knowledge store), DGX Spark (compute)
  examples:
    - FACT → "EURUSD closed at 1.0847"
    - CLAIM → "HTF bias is bearish based on weekly OB rejection"
    - SIGNAL → "OTE + FVG confluence valid for London short"
    - PROPOSAL_REJECTED → full context of why trade was declined
    - SKILL → distilled lesson from Dream Cycle analysis
  tempo: Fast, high-frequency, allowed to be wrong
  rule: "Every bead is a sensor reading. Mine everything."

THE_BRIDGE:
  direction: Economy 2 → Economy 1 (one-way valve)
  mechanism: SKILL beads validated through stress testing
  invariant: |
    INV-BRIDGE-PROMOTION-GATE:
    "Analytical findings enter Governance economy ONLY as validated SKILL beads.
     SKILL.validation_status must be VALIDATED before conditioning agent behavior.
     Prevents hallucinated alpha from reaching execution engine."

  reverse_flow: Economy 1 → Economy 2 (observation, not authority)
  mechanism: |
    Governance events PROJECT into Analytical economy as FACT beads.
    "Phoenix halted lease X at time T for reason R" → FACT bead.
    The Dream Cycle mines Phoenix's BEHAVIOR as data,
    not Phoenix's INTERNALS as code.

DESIGN_PRINCIPLE: |
  The Bead Field is not a log. It is a high-resolution physics experiment.
  Every bead is a sensor reading of a specific market/logic collision.
  A log says "what happened." A physics experiment says "what were the
  conditions, what was measured, what was the apparatus state, and
  can we reproduce it?" Bi-temporal + attestation gives us reproducibility.
```

## 3. HARDWARE TOPOLOGY

```yaml
NODE_DGX — NVIDIA DGX Spark (Grace-Blackwell):
  status: ARRIVED (2026-02-21) — standing by for Gate 5+
  role: COMPUTE PLANE (Economy 2 heavy lifting)
  function: Dream Cycle, SkillRL distillation, adversarial simulation, Monte Carlo
  specs: 20-core Arm, GB10 GPU, 128GB unified, 1 PFLOP FP4
  sovereignty: Worker, NOT authority. No keys, no control decisions.

NODE_M3 — Mac Studio M3 Ultra (512GB):
  role: KNOWLEDGE SUBSTRATE + CONTROL PLANE
  function: Bead Field store, coordination, orchestration, local large models
  specs: 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU, 512GB unified
  sovereignty: All critical services, keys, DBs reside here.

NODE_M4 — Mac Studio M4 Max (64GB):
  role: CORE DEVELOPMENT + PHOENIX EXECUTION
  function: Phoenix codebase, sprint execution, test suites
  sovereignty: Production governance engine.

NODE_MINIS — Mac Mini Gateway Nodes:
  role: LIGHTWEIGHT COORDINATION
  function: G sovereign sessions, CSO office, monitoring, Claude Desktop

NODE_VPS — ChadBoar (Singapore):
  role: DISPOSABLE CANARY
  function: Bead Field pattern validation under real autonomous operation
  sovereignty: Sandboxed. 14 SOL play money. No connection to core.

CONNECTIVITY:
  core: Encrypted LAN (10GbE) DGX ↔ M3 Ultra
  coordination: Git-based (phoenix-swarm/)
  isolation: Each office owns its repo scope, no shared runtime

FALLBACK: |
  M3 Ultra can run local models if DGX unavailable (degraded but sovereign).
  All offices can operate on API (OpenRouter $1-3/day) before local hardware.
  Hardware enhances but is never required for sovereign function.
```

## 4. THE PULSE (Operational Heartbeat)

The Pulse is the 24-hour rhythm that transforms static infrastructure into a living refinery.

```yaml
PHASE_1 — LIVE_MONITORING (Market Hours):
  window: Regional session hours (London 07:00-16:00, NY 13:00-21:00 UTC)
  hardware: M3 Ultra (control) + M4 Max (Phoenix execution)
  dgx_role: STANDBY (light monitoring, no heavy compute)
  activity:
    - IBKR live data stream → FACT beads (WT-stamped)
    - CSO gate evaluation → CLAIM beads (5-drawer status)
    - Signal generation → SIGNAL beads (tradeable thesis)
    - Proposal lifecycle → PROPOSAL / PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads
    - Governance enforcement → lease, halt, state lock beads
  human_role: G monitors via HUD + mobile command. Olya validates signals.
  tempo: Real-time. Governance economy dominant.

PHASE_2 — POLLEN_INGESTION (Continuous):
  window: Always-on (background, throttled during live monitoring)
  hardware: M3 Ultra (orchestration) + DGX Spark (processing)
  activity:
    - External intelligence gathering (X, YouTube, macro research)
    - Source → FACT beads with source_type: OPEN_SOURCE
    - Narrative extraction and regime context building
    - Perplexity deep-dives on emerging themes
  bead_treatment: |
    All external intelligence enters as FACT beads with explicit provenance.
    Source quality tiering: CANON > OLYA_PRIMARY > LATERAL > REFERENCE
    No external data becomes CLAIM without agent reasoning trace.
  tempo: Continuous drip. Low priority, high value over time.

PHASE_3 — DREAM_CYCLE (Off-Hours):
  window: Post-session (typically 22:00-06:00 UTC, configurable)
  hardware: DGX Spark (PRIMARY — earns its keep here) + M3 Ultra (Bead Field queries)
  activity:
    - Shadow Field mining: load PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads from the day
    - Counterfactual simulation: "In what universe would this have been correct?"
    - Synthetic noise injection: replay with +200ms latency, -50% liquidity
    - SkillRL distillation: failure trajectories → SKILL candidates
    - Paradigm review: high-context agents question assumptions laterally
    - Adversarial agents trade AGAINST Phoenix strategies (market-neutral eval)
  output: SKILL candidate beads (CANDIDATE status, await validation)
  tempo: Heavy compute. Analytical economy dominant. DGX at full utilization.

PHASE_4 — MIRROR_REPORT (Pre-Session):
  window: 06:00-07:00 UTC (before London open, configurable per regime)
  hardware: M3 Ultra (synthesis) + DGX Spark (final computations)
  activity:
    - Overnight findings synthesized into structured report
    - New SKILL candidates surfaced with evidence chains
    - Refinery Latency trends (system getting faster or slower?)
    - Execution Fidelity metrics (intent vs fill delta)
    - Regime assessment for upcoming session
    - Anomaly flags (hallucination detection via near-zero WT-KT delta)
  output: |
    Mirror Report bead (type: CLAIM, temporal_class: DERIVED)
    Delivered to G via dashboard/mobile before market open.
    This is the refinery's "daily intelligence briefing."
  human_action: |
    G reviews. Olya validates any methodology-relevant findings.
    Validated SKILLs promote to VALIDATED status.
    Rejected findings → NEGATIVE_BEAD → future Dream Cycle input.
  tempo: Synthesis. Bridge between economies. Human gate.

THE_99.8_PERCENT_PRINCIPLE: |
  In a system that scans 1,000 setups and picks 2, the 998 rejections
  are more valuable than the 2 successes. The Shadow Field (PROPOSAL_REJECTED)
  is the primary fuel for the Dream Cycle. The system learns more from
  what it declined than from what it executed.
```

---

## 5. SOVEREIGNTY MODEL

```yaml
HUMANS:
  G:
    authority: SUPREME — all offices report to G
    functions: [strategic direction, capital allocation, hardware decisions,
                cross-context bridge, sprint approval, conflict resolution]
    veto: BROADCAST.md → all offices halt on wake

  OLYA:
    authority: DOMAIN — sovereign over trading methodology
    functions: [CLAIM→FACT promotion, gate calibration, curriculum curation,
                hypothesis drafting, Mirror Report validation]
    veto: "Olya's NO is absolute and final. No appeal. Feeds back as NEGATIVE_BEAD."
    principle: "Recognition over recall — show her patterns, she validates"
    insight: "Forensic surgeon, not morgue consumer — depth over breadth"

INVARIANTS:
  INV-HUMAN-FRAMES: "Human frames mission. Machine computes. Human promotes."
  INV-SOVEREIGN-VETO: "G can halt any task via BROADCAST"
  INV-OLYA-ABSOLUTE: "Olya's NO on methodology is final"
  INV-CAPITAL-GATE: "No live execution without human T2 approval"
  INV-BRIDGE-PROMOTION-GATE: "Analytical→Governance only via validated SKILL beads"

OLYA_VETO_IN_BEAD_TERMS: |
  PROPOSAL_REJECTED with:
    rejection_source: HUMAN
    rejection_category: HUMAN_OVERRIDE
    rejection_reason: structured (Olya's specific objection)
  Captured, classified, routed to Dream Cycle. Nothing lost.

THE_DELTA_PRINCIPLE: |
  Three ore sources converge: ICT (tradition), Lateral (context), Olya (practice).
  The delta between what ICT teaches, what laterals suggest, and what Olya
  actually does in practice IS the edge. The system mines this delta.
```

## 7. THE BEAD FIELD (Summary)

Full specification in `BEAD_FIELD_SPEC_v0.3.md`. Summary here for orientation.

```yaml
WHAT: Core data substrate. Every fact, claim, signal, proposal, rejection, skill.
WHY: The moat. If beads are weak, everything downstream is noise.

THREE_LAYERS:
  ephemeral: Agent thinking (disposable, unsigned, no cost)
  structural: Logical Commitments (permanent, signed, bi-temporal, Merkle-anchored)
  attestation: Proof of HOW each structural bead was produced

EIGHT_ANALYTICAL_TYPES:
  FACT: Market data, events (from providers or OPEN_SOURCE intelligence)
  CLAIM: Agent inference with reasoning trace
  SIGNAL: Tradeable thesis with derivation and risk profile
  PROPOSAL: Trade intent that passed all gates
  PROPOSAL_REJECTED: Declined trade — FULL context (Shadow Field fuel)
  SKILL: Distilled lesson from Dream Cycle
  MODEL_VERSION: Model metadata and deployment status
  POLICY: Risk rules, position limits, regime definitions

BI_TEMPORAL:
  world_time: "When was this true in reality?" (span)
  knowledge_time: "When did the system learn this?" (point)
  refinery_latency: WT-to-KT delta (first-class metric, hallucination detector)

COMMITMENT_THRESHOLD: |
  Formal Handoff protocol. commit() to WORK_TREE is the bright line.
  Observation ≠ Incorporation. If in doubt, don't bead it.

SHADOW_FIELD: |
  All PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads. The 99.8% negative space.
  Primary fuel for Dream Cycle. Must contain FULL proposal context.

ANCESTRAL_RESERVE: |
  789 Genesis beads (curated from 1178 extractions). Genesis Snapshot.
  Single Merkle tree, root signed by G. Bead Zero.

INTEGRITY:
  hash_chain: Per-stream SHA-256 linking
  merkle: Hybrid trigger (Decision Boundary + 500 bead / 1hr fallback)
  signing: Dual PQC (Dilithium) + ECDSA (secp256r1)
  sovereign_anchor: Daily ledger root signed with offline HSM
```

## 9. DECISION ARCHITECTURE

Key rulings that shape the system. Fresh instances must know these.

```yaml
# Analytical Architecture
DEC-BINARY-CLAIM-FACT: "No intermediate PROVISIONAL_FACT. Binary only."
DEC-TEMPORAL-BOUNDING: "DERIVED WT = intersection of OBSERVATION spans. Pattern inputs provide logic, not time."
DEC-MERKLE-HYBRID: "Decision Boundary + fallback caps (500 beads / 1hr). No infinite batches."
DEC-GENESIS-SNAPSHOT: "789 Genesis beads bundled as single Merkle root. Bead Zero."
DEC-FORMAL-HANDOFF: "commit() is the bright line. Observation ≠ Incorporation."
DEC-PQC-FOUNDATIONAL: "Software-first PQC+ECDSA from Day 1. TEE is additional, not foundational."

# Governance Architecture
DEC-CARTRIDGE-LEASE: "Cartridge = WHAT (strategy identity). Lease = WHEN/HOW MUCH (governance wrapper)."
DEC-PERISH-DEFAULT: "Leases expire without ceremony. No auto-renew, ever."
DEC-SLEEP-SAFE: "Self-healing patterns, not self-modifying. New strategies don't need bespoke governance."
DEC-CONVERGENCE-NOT-CORRECTNESS: "Agent consensus doesn't imply correctness. Fidelity validation required."

# Operational Architecture
DEC-TWO-ECONOMIES: "Governance beads and analytical beads are separate systems with a one-way bridge."
DEC-PROJECTION-NOT-PARTICIPATION: "Phoenix projects into Bead Field. Bead Field doesn't modify Phoenix internals."
DEC-RIVER-INTERNAL: "Phoenix keeps River doctrine internally. Event bus (NATS/Kafka) is swarm-level only."
DEC-COE-MODEL: "Centre of Excellence: Olya validates (recognition), not extracts (recall)."
DEC-PHYSICS-EXPERIMENT: "Bead Field is a physics experiment, not a log. Sensor readings, not diary entries."
```
