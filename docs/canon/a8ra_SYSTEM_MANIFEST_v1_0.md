# a8ra SYSTEM MANIFEST

```yaml
document: SYSTEM_MANIFEST
version: 1.1
date: 2026-02-22
status: CANONICAL — updated post v0.1 SEAL + Bead Field Gate 1
purpose: Single M2M orientation for every Claude instance in the a8ra ecosystem
update_discipline: Any session making a significant decision appends a MANIFEST DELTA
owner: G (Sovereign Operator)
supersedes: SYSTEM_MANIFEST v0.1 (Dexter CTO draft)
```

## 0. READ THIS FIRST

You are a Claude instance serving one office in the a8ra ecosystem. You do not have access to other offices' conversation histories. This document is the single source of truth for the system as a whole.

```yaml
PRECEDENCE:
  cross_cutting: This manifest wins (invariants, data schema, security)
  office_specific: Your office docs win (implementation details)
  world_view: Read a8ra_MASTER_PLAN.md for strategic context
```

## 1. WHAT a8ra IS

```yaml
NAME: a8ra (pronounced "a-eight-ra")
TYPE: Sovereign Intelligence Refinery
CORE_PRINCIPLE: "Human frames. Machine computes. Human promotes."

TWO_ECONOMIES:
  governance: Deterministic system state (Phoenix, 17+ bead types, battle-tested)
  analytical: Mineable knowledge substrate (Bead Field, 8 types, bi-temporal, signed)
  bridge: One-way valve — analytical→governance only via validated SKILL beads
  detail: See a8ra_MASTER_PLAN.md Section 2
```

---

## 2. HUMANS

```yaml
G:
  role: Sovereign Operator
  authority: SUPREME
  function: Strategic direction, capital allocation, cross-context bridge, sprint approval
  veto: BROADCAST.md → all offices halt on wake

OLYA:
  role: CSO / Oracle
  authority: DOMAIN — sovereign over trading methodology
  function: CLAIM→FACT promotion, gate calibration, curriculum curation
  veto: Absolute and final. No appeal. Rejection → NEGATIVE_BEAD → Dream Cycle.
  principle: "Recognition over recall. Forensic surgeon, not morgue consumer."
```

## 4. COMPONENT STATUS

### 4.1 Phoenix (Constitutional Trading System)

```yaml
status: v0.1 SEALED (2026-02-22)
repo: phoenix/ (private, tag: v0.1)
current_sprint: S50 COMPLETE — SEALED

cumulative_metrics:
  sprints_complete: 20 (S28-S44, S46-S50)
  tests_passing: 1615
  xfailed: 22 (documented, strict)
  chaos_vectors: 264/264 PASS
  invariants_frozen: 150+ (18 constitutional + 95+ subsystem + 21 methodology + 17 MC)
  bead_types: 17+
  gates_mapped: 48
  seal_date: 2026-02-22

architecture:
  governance: |
    Lease/Cartridge system (S46 design locked, S47 implemented).
    Cartridge = WHAT (strategy identity). Lease = WHEN/HOW MUCH (governance wrapper).
    State machine: DRAFT→ACTIVE→EXPIRED|REVOKED|HALTED.
    Insertion: 8-step protocol with rollback.
    Ceremony: Weekly attestation, PERISH_BY_DEFAULT.
  execution: |
    9-state position lifecycle. T2 human gate for capital.
    IBKR integration (paper mode validated, live ready).
    Halt: <50ms local, <500ms cascade.
  cso: |
    5-drawer gate evaluation via cabinet model v1.1 (48 gates).
    Each cartridge carries complete self-contained DrawerConfig.
    Canonical drawers: HTF_BIAS, MARKET_STRUCTURE, PREMIUM_DISCOUNT, ENTRY_MODEL, CONFIRMATION.
    methodology_template.yaml as reference (conditions.yaml retained for imports).
    Boolean only (INV-HARNESS-1). No grades, no confidence scores.
    CSE emission with evidence. Multi-pair scan.
  monitoring: |
    Heartbeat, semantic health, HUD surface (SwiftUI, <500ms latency).
    manifest_writer.py bridges state to HUD.
  memory: |
    Athena: CLAIM/FACT/CONFLICT bead separation (S37).
    BeadStore: Append-only, provenance-linked.
    CFP: Conditional fact projector with causal ban (S35).
    Hunt: Exhaustive grid, no survivor ranking (S38).

key_blockers:
  s45: BLOCKED (Olya CSO calibration — CoE model accepted, not required for v0.1)
  rule: INV-NO-CORE-REWRITES-POST-S44 ACTIVE
  note: v0.1 shipped without S45. S45 is post-v0.1 enhancement.

integration_with_bead_field:
  pattern: Projection, not participation (proven in S48 HUD)
  mechanism: Phoenix governance events → Bridge → FACT beads in analytical store
  phoenix_change: Minimal (emit, bridge enriches)
  timeline: Post Phoenix v0.1, post Bead Field Gate 1
```

cannot_test: [multi-agent, cross-node HLC, PQC, XTDB, DGX compute, agent handoff, HSM]
```

### 4.4 Mission Control
