# BEAD_FIELD_SPEC v0.1

```yaml
document: BEAD_FIELD_SPEC
version: 0.3
date: 2026-02-20
status: CANONICAL — Three-office approved, ready for Gate 1
authors: G (Sovereign Operator) + CTO (Claude) + Owl (Gemini Advisor) + Perplexity (Research)
purpose: Constitutional schema for the a8ra Sovereign Data Layer
scope: Bead types, bi-temporal semantics, commitment thresholds, integrity model
amendments:
  v0.2: |
    Incorporated 5 Owl pressure-test findings:
    1. Commitment Threshold → "Formal Handoff" protocol (Section 2.2)
    2. Temporal Inheritance → "Bounding Constraint" replaces union (Section 4.2)
    3. Merkle Anchoring → Hybrid Trigger with fallback caps (Section 5.2)
    4. Ancestral Reserve → Genesis Snapshot with single Merkle root (Section 6)
    5. Rejection Reasons → Policy Bead references, not free strings (Section 3.2)
  v0.3: |
    Added OPEN_SOURCE to source_type enum (Section 3.1).
    Captures external intelligence (social, narrative, macro research)
    as distinct from MARKET_DATA providers and EXTRACTION methodology mining.
    Source: Owl Pulse gap analysis + Phoenix CTO triage (2026-02-20).

## 0. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the **Bead Field** — the core data substrate for the a8ra Sovereign Intelligence Refinery.

Every fact, claim, signal, proposal, rejection, and skill in the system exists as a **Bead**: a cryptographically anchored, bi-temporally stamped, provenance-linked unit of knowledge.

The Bead Field is the moat. If the schema is weak, retrieval degrades at scale, provenance becomes untraceable, and the Dream Cycle has nothing meaningful to mine. This spec exists to prevent that.

**Design Principles:**
- Commitment-based, not thought-based (only Logical Commitments become Beads)
- Structurally rich rejections (failures are as valuable as successes)
- Bi-temporal by default (every Bead knows "when in the world" and "when we learned")
- Cryptographically anchored (tamper-evident, auditable end-to-end)
- Hardware-agnostic sovereignty (software signing first, hardware TEE layered on)

## 1. Physical Topology

### 1.1 Hardware Roles

```yaml
NODE_A — NVIDIA DGX Spark (Grace–Blackwell):
  role: Compute Plane
  function: Dream Cycle, SkillRL distillation, adversarial simulation, heavy inference
  specs: 20-core Arm CPU, GB10 GPU, 128GB unified memory, 1 PFLOP FP4
  sovereignty: Compute worker, NOT control authority

NODE_B — Mac Studio M3 Ultra (512GB):
  role: Knowledge Substrate + Control Plane
  function: Bead Field store, coordination, orchestration, dashboards, high-context reasoning
  specs: 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 512GB unified memory
  sovereignty: All critical services, keys, and DBs reside here

NODE_C — Mac Studio M4 Max (64GB):
  role: Core Development + Phoenix Execution
  function: Phoenix production codebase, sprint execution, test suites
  specs: Existing hardware, dev-primary workloads

NODE_D+ — Mac Mini Gateway Nodes:
  role: Lightweight coordination, CSO office, monitoring
  function: Git sync, task watching, review workflows

CONNECTIVITY:
  backbone: Encrypted LAN (10GbE) between DGX Spark and M3 Ultra
  pattern: Control plane on M3 Ultra, compute plane on DGX Spark
  fallback: M3 Ultra can run local models if DGX unavailable (degraded but sovereign)
```

### 1.2 Storage Topology

```yaml
BEAD_FIELD_STORE:
  engine: XTDB-style bitemporal layer (or equivalent)
  location: M3 Ultra (primary), DGX Spark (read replica for Dream Cycle)
  purpose: High-performance bi-temporal range queries at scale
  query_language: Datalog or SQL with WT/KT predicates

WORK_TREE:
  status: SUPERSEDED by git-based coordination (phoenix-swarm). See DRIFT_LOG DELTA-3.
  engine: Originally Dolt (Git-for-Data) — not implemented
  location: M3 Ultra
  purpose: Agent coordination, task state, logic versioning, branch/merge
  NOT_FOR: High-frequency bead queries (control plane only)

EPHEMERAL_STORE:
  engine: Session logs (append-only, non-indexed)
  location: Per-node local storage
  purpose: Agent chain-of-thought, working memory, disposable reasoning
  retention: Configurable (default 7 days, then purge)
```

---

## 2. The Three-Layer Model

All system cognition falls into exactly one of three layers.

### 2.1 Layer Definitions

```yaml
LAYER_1 — EPHEMERAL COGNITION:
  what: Agent internal reasoning, chain-of-thought, exploratory thinking
  stored_as: Session logs (plain text / JSONL)
  merkle_verified: NO
  bi_temporal: NO
  signed: NO
  retention: Disposable (configurable TTL)
  examples:
    - "Maybe the regime shifted... let me check HTF"
    - Internal LLM reasoning tokens
    - Draft calculations before commitment
  rule: "Thinking out loud — no record, no provenance, no cost"

LAYER_2 — STRUCTURAL BEADS:
  what: Logical Commitments that change system state or inform decisions
  stored_as: Bead Field (XTDB-style bitemporal store)
  merkle_verified: YES
  bi_temporal: YES (world_time span + knowledge_time point)
  signed: YES (PQC Dilithium + ECDSA dual signature)
  retention: Permanent (append-only, never deleted)
  examples:
    - FACT: "EURUSD closed at 1.0847 on 2026-02-19"
    - CLAIM: "HTF bias is bearish based on weekly OB rejection"
    - SIGNAL: "OTE + FVG confluence valid for London session short"
    - PROPOSAL: "Enter short EURUSD at 1.0855, SL 1.0880, TP 1.0790"
    - PROPOSAL_REJECTED: Full context of why proposal was declined
    - SKILL: Distilled lesson from Dream Cycle analysis
    - MODEL_VERSION: Metadata for any model used in production
    - POLICY: Risk rules, position limits, regime definitions
  rule: "Speaking for the record — permanent, provable, mineable"

LAYER_3 — ATTESTATION ENVELOPE:
  what: Proof of HOW a structural bead was produced
  stored_as: Embedded in each structural bead's attestation field
  merkle_verified: YES (part of bead hash)
  purpose: Proves code version, model version, input set, execution context
  rule: "The bead is WHAT was decided. The attestation is HOW it was decided."
```

### 2.2 The Commitment Threshold

**An agent writes a Structural Bead when, and only when, it makes a state-changing Logical Commitment.**

```yaml
MANDATORY_BEADS (always committed):
  - Any PROPOSAL (trade intent)
  - Any PROPOSAL_REJECTED (declined trade — FULL context required)
  - Any SIGNAL (tradeable expression with derivation)
  - Any FACT ingestion (market data, events)
  - Any MODEL_VERSION change (deployment, rollback)
  - Any POLICY change (risk rules, regime definitions)

CONDITIONAL_BEADS (committed only via Formal Handoff):
  - A CLAIM that is written to the WORK_TREE (Dolt) as a completed task artifact
  - A regime assessment that another agent incorporates as a premise
  - An intermediate inference explicitly committed via commit() call

  formal_handoff_protocol: |
    The Commitment Threshold is enforced via "Formal Handoff":
    - If Agent A wants Agent B to RELY on a conclusion, Agent A must commit() it.
    - If Agent B merely MONITORS Agent A's thinking, it remains Ephemeral.
    - Observation (reading another agent's draft) ≠ Incorporation (using it as premise).
    - The act of writing to the WORK_TREE is the bright line.

    This prevents the swarm from drowning the Structural Layer in noise
    when agents "peek" at each other's working memory during coordination.

  threshold_test: |
    "Has this inference been formally committed to the WORK_TREE
     as a completed artifact that other agents may incorporate?"
    If YES → Bead it.
    If NO  → Ephemeral.

NEVER_BEADED:
  - Internal chain-of-thought steps
  - Draft calculations that are superseded
  - Exploratory reasoning that leads nowhere
  - Agent-to-agent chatter during coordination
```

  notes: |
    quality_score is provider-reported confidence, NOT a Dexter judgment.

    not analytical quality. INV-NO-GRADES still applies to all other bead types.
```

## 4. Bi-Temporal Semantics

### 4.1 Definitions

```yaml
WORLD_TIME (WT):
  meaning: "When was this true in external reality?"
  representation: Span [world_time_valid_from, world_time_valid_to]
  examples:
    - FACT (EURUSD close): WT = [2026-02-19T17:00:00Z, 2026-02-19T17:00:00Z] (point)
    - CLAIM (regime trending): WT = [2026-02-19T08:00:00Z, 2026-02-19T14:32:00Z] (observation window)
    - CLAIM (OTE is valid entry model): WT = [null, null] (pattern, timeless)
    - SIGNAL (short EURUSD London): WT = [2026-02-19T07:00:00Z, 2026-02-19T11:00:00Z] (session window)

KNOWLEDGE_TIME (KT):
  meaning: "When did the system learn/commit this?"
  representation: Point — knowledge_time_recorded_at
  clock: Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)
  examples:
    - FACT ingested at 14:32:07.123456 → KT = 2026-02-19T14:32:07.123456Z
    - CLAIM committed at 14:33:01.789012 → KT = 2026-02-19T14:33:01.789012Z
    - Dream Cycle skill distilled at 03:15:22.456789 → KT = 2026-02-20T03:15:22.456789Z
```

### 4.2 Temporal Classes

```yaml
OBSERVATION:
  world_time: Required span (both from and to populated)
  use: Market data, regime assessments, session-specific signals
  query_pattern: "What did we observe about EURUSD during London session on Feb 19?"

PATTERN:
  world_time: Null (valid across all time)
  use: Methodology CLAIMs, skills, structural trading rules
  query_pattern: "Show all PATTERN CLAIMs about OTE entry models"
  note: The 789 ancestral CLAIMs (curated from 1178 extractions) are PATTERN class

DERIVED:
  world_time: Bounding Constraint from OBSERVATION-class inputs only
  use: Computed beads (signals, proposals) that synthesize multiple inputs
  query_pattern: "Show all DERIVED SIGNALs that depended on a regime CLAIM from today"

  inheritance_rule: |
    DERIVED WT = Intersection of all OBSERVATION-class input spans.
    PATTERN-class inputs provide LOGIC but contribute ZERO temporal validity.

    A SIGNAL is only valid for as long as its most volatile OBSERVATION input
    is valid. If the market data FACT expires, the SIGNAL expires.

    Example:
      Input A: PATTERN CLAIM "OTE is valid entry" (WT: null) → provides logic
      Input B: OBSERVATION CLAIM "HTF bearish" (WT: 08:00–14:00) → provides temporal bound
      Input C: OBSERVATION FACT "EURUSD at 1.0847" (WT: 14:32) → provides temporal bound

      DERIVED SIGNAL WT = intersection of B and C = [14:32, 14:32]
      (bounded by the most recent observation, not expanded by the pattern)

    The "Null Union Paradox" is avoided: null + span ≠ timeless signal.
    Patterns constrain WHAT is valid. Observations constrain WHEN it's valid.
```

### 4.3 Refinery Latency

```yaml
DEFINITION: |
  The delta between world_time_valid_to and knowledge_time_recorded_at.
  Measures how long the system takes to "understand" a market state change.

FORMULA: |
  refinery_latency = knowledge_time_recorded_at - world_time_valid_to

INTERPRETATION:
  narrowing: System is getting faster at recognizing market state
  widening: System is getting sluggish (potential degradation signal)
  baseline: Establish per-bead-type and per-regime benchmarks

METRIC_STATUS: First-class operational metric, tracked per bead type
```

### 4.4 Bi-Temporal Query Examples

```yaml
EXAMPLE_1 — "What did we know on Jan 1 about Q4 2025?":
  query: |
    SELECT * FROM beads
    WHERE knowledge_time_recorded_at <= '2026-01-01T00:00:00Z'
    AND world_time_valid_from >= '2025-10-01T00:00:00Z'
    AND world_time_valid_to <= '2025-12-31T23:59:59Z'
  purpose: Reconstruct state of knowledge at any past point

EXAMPLE_2 — "Show all regime CLAIMs for EURUSD London session today":
  query: |
    SELECT * FROM beads
    WHERE bead_type = 'CLAIM'
    AND content->>'drawer' = 'HTF_BIAS'
    AND tags @> '["EURUSD", "LONDON_SESSION"]'
    AND world_time_valid_from >= '2026-02-20T07:00:00Z'
    AND world_time_valid_to <= '2026-02-20T11:00:00Z'

EXAMPLE_3 — "Average refinery latency for SIGNALs this week":
  query: |
    SELECT AVG(knowledge_time_recorded_at - world_time_valid_to) as avg_latency
    FROM beads
    WHERE bead_type = 'SIGNAL'
    AND knowledge_time_recorded_at >= '2026-02-17T00:00:00Z'
```

## 5. Integrity Model

### 5.1 Hash Chain

```yaml
PER_STREAM_CHAINING:
  description: |
    Each logical stream (e.g., per-instrument, per-agent, per-session)
    maintains its own hash chain via hash_prev.
  purpose: Tamper detection within a stream
  verification: Walk chain backward, verify each hash_prev matches prior bead's hash_self

HASH_COMPUTATION:
  algorithm: SHA-256
  input: Canonical JSON serialization of (content + all metadata except hash_self, merkle_batch_id)
  determinism: Same inputs MUST produce same hash (canonical JSON ordering required)
```

### 5.2 Merkle Anchoring

```yaml
ANCHORING_TRIGGER: Hybrid (Decision Boundary + Fallback Caps)
  description: |
    Primary trigger: SIGNAL or PROPOSAL bead committed (Decision Boundary).
    Fallback triggers prevent "Infinite Batch" in cold regimes:
    - MAX_BEADS: 500 beads since last anchor (prevents massive backfill operations)
    - MAX_TIME: 1 hour since last anchor (ensures regular integrity checkpoints)

    Whichever trigger fires first wins.

    Rationale: In a "Cold Regime" (no trades for 48 hours) with high research
    activity (10,000 FACTs and CLAIMs), the fallback caps keep Merkle trees
    shallow and backfill operations deterministic and performant on the M3 Ultra.

  trigger_precedence:
    1: DECISION_BOUNDARY (SIGNAL or PROPOSAL committed)
    2: MAX_BEADS_REACHED (500 beads since last anchor, configurable)
    3: MAX_TIME_ELAPSED (1 hour since last anchor, configurable)

BATCH_CONTENTS:
  - All structural beads committed since last anchor
  - Merkle tree built over their hash_self values
  - Root stored in each bead's merkle_batch_id field (backfilled)

ANCHOR_RECORD:
  merkle_batch_id: string (UUID v7)
  merkle_root: string (SHA-256 root of batch tree)
  bead_count: integer
  timestamp: datetime (KT of anchor event)
  trigger_bead_id: string (the SIGNAL/PROPOSAL that triggered anchoring)

SOVEREIGN_ANCHOR (daily):
  status: DESIGNED_NOT_BUILT (Gate 7). No HSM code exists. See DRIFT_LOG DELTA-5.
  description: |
    Daily ledger root snapshot signed with offline sovereign key (HSM).
    Covers all Merkle batches from the day.
  frequency: Once per day (end of NY session or configurable)
  key_storage: Offline HSM (not accessible to any agent)
  purpose: External audit point — proves state at any past day
```

### 5.3 Signing Protocol (PQC-First)

```yaml
DUAL_SIGNATURE:
  purpose: Hardware-agnostic sovereignty + post-quantum readiness
  signatures:
    ecdsa:
      algorithm: ECDSA secp256r1
      purpose: Immediate compatibility, widely verifiable
    pqc:
      algorithm: Dilithium (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, NIST PQC standard)
      purpose: Quantum-resistant, future-proof

SIGNING_SCOPE: Every structural bead is signed at commitment time
VERIFICATION: Either signature alone is sufficient for validation
RATIONALE: |
  TEE.fail research (Oct 2025) proved hardware enclaves are breakable.
  Software signing makes the system sovereign regardless of hardware state.
  Hardware TEE (Blackwell Confidential Compute) is an ADDITIONAL layer, not the foundation.
```

## 6. Ancestral Reserve

### 6.1 Genesis Snapshot

```yaml
THE_789_CLAIMS:
  status: Ancestral Reserve — the Gold Reserve backing the new currency
  count: 789 (curated from 1178 raw extractions — see genesis/curator.py)
  migration: NONE — these are not "migrated," they are the Genesis Block
  temporal_class: PATTERN (world_time null, valid across all time)
  lineage: Root beads (empty lineage array — they ARE the axioms)
  tags: ["ANCESTRAL", "EXTRACTION_PHASE", source-specific tags]

GENESIS_SNAPSHOT:
  description: |
    The 789 PATTERN beads are NOT treated as 789 individual start-points.
    They are bundled into a single Genesis Merkle Tree.
    The root of this tree is signed with the Sovereign Key (G).
    This becomes "Bead Zero" — the Atomic Origin of the entire refinery.

    Every future bead in the system has a lineage that can be traced
    back to this Genesis Root. It provides cryptographic proof that
    the methodology foundation was established at a known point in time
    by a known authority.

  implementation:
    1: Hash all 789 CLAIMs with current schema (retroactive hash_self)
    2: Build Merkle tree over all 789 hash_self values
    3: Sign Merkle root with Sovereign Key (G, offline HSM)
    4: Store Genesis Record as a special POLICY bead:
      bead_type: POLICY
      policy_name: "GENESIS_ANCHOR"
      content: { merkle_root, bead_count: 789, signed_by: "G" }
    5: All 789 beads get merkle_batch_id pointing to Genesis Record
    6: Future lineage references can trace to any ancestral CLAIM
       and verify it was part of the signed Genesis set

RELATIONSHIP_TO_NEW_BEADS:
  pattern: |
    New SIGNAL and PROPOSAL beads reference ancestral CLAIMs
    via their lineage array. The ancestral beads provide the
    methodology foundation; live observations provide the market context.

  example: |
    SIGNAL bead for "Short EURUSD at OTE" would have lineage:
    [
      "ancestral-claim-OTE-valid-entry",     # PATTERN (from Genesis set)
      "live-claim-htf-bearish-2026-02-20",   # OBSERVATION (from today)
      "live-fact-eurusd-1.0847-close"         # OBSERVATION (market data)
    ]
```

## 7. Agent Integrity Runtime (AIR)

> **STATUS: DESIGNED_NOT_BUILT (Gate 3).** No AIR code exists. See DRIFT_LOG DELTA-4.

### 7.1 Overview

```yaml
PURPOSE: |
  Every agent action that can affect markets or system state is:
  - Authenticated to a specific code + config state
  - Executed in a verified environment
  - Signed with PQC + ECDSA dual signatures

ARCHITECTURE:
  software_layer: PQC signing + HLC + hash chains (FOUNDATIONAL — Day 1)
  hardware_layer: Blackwell Confidential Compute TEE (ADDITIONAL — when tooling matures)
  rationale: Software attestation makes system sovereign even if hardware is compromised
```

### 7.2 AIR Gate Protocol

```yaml
HIGH_IMPACT_ACTIONS (require full AIR gate):
  - Placing any order (live or paper)
  - Publishing a SIGNAL bead
  - Changing a POLICY bead
  - Deploying a MODEL_VERSION
  - Promoting CLAIM → referenced by SIGNAL

GATE_SEQUENCE:
  1_ASSEMBLE: |
    Orchestrator builds Execution Plan:
    - Agent identity + code hash
    - Requested action
    - Input bead set (with hash verification)
    - Target model version (if applicable)

  2_VERIFY: |
    AIR checks:
    - Code hash matches approved build
    - Model version hash present and approved in MODEL_VERSION beads
    - All input beads verified (hash_self + Merkle proof)
    - No POLICY violations in proposed action

  3_EXECUTE: |
    Action executes in verified context.
    Produces output bead + execution trace.

  4_SIGN: |
    AIR signs output bead (PQC + ECDSA).
    Trace is stored in attestation envelope.

  5_COMMIT: |
    Bead Field ingests signed output.
    Unsigned mutations are REJECTED and logged as security events.
```

## 8. The Shadow Field & Dream Cycle Interface

### 8.1 Shadow Field Definition

```yaml
SHADOW_FIELD: |
  The collection of all PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads in the Bead Field.
  This is the negative space — what the system considered and declined.
  It is the primary fuel for the Dream Cycle's SkillRL distillation.

RICHNESS_REQUIREMENT: |
  A PROPOSAL_REJECTED bead MUST contain the full context of the failure:
  - The complete proposal (identical structure to PROPOSAL)
  - The specific rejection reason (structured, categorical)
  - The risk state at time of rejection
  - The input chain (lineage back to supporting CLAIMs and FACTs)

  A rejection without the "why" is noise.
  A rejection without the full proposal is unmatchable.
  The Dream Cycle cannot learn from what it cannot trace.
```

### 8.2 Dream Cycle Intake

```yaml
DREAM_CYCLE_READS:
  primary_input: PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads (the Shadow Field)
  secondary_input: PROPOSAL beads that were executed (success trajectories)
  tertiary_input: SKILL beads (existing learned skills, for refinement)

DREAM_CYCLE_WRITES:
  output: SKILL beads (distilled lessons)
  feedback: Updated counterfactual_summary on PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads
  links: linked_skills populated on source PROPOSAL_REJECTED beads

PIPELINE:
  1: Librarian loads PROPOSAL_REJECTED + context (lineage walk)
  2: Researcher runs counterfactual simulation on DGX (historical + synthetic regimes)
  3: Leakage diagnostics computed (PC, CI, IDS metrics)
  4: SkillRL distills failure trajectories into SKILL candidates
  5: Skills written as CANDIDATE beads, await validation
  6: Human validates → SKILL status promoted to VALIDATED
  7: Validated skills condition future agent behavior
```

## 9. Non-Negotiable Invariants

```yaml
INV-BEAD-IMMUTABLE:
  rule: "Structural beads are append-only. No mutation, only supersession or retraction."
  enforcement: Bead Field store rejects UPDATE operations on existing beads.

INV-BEAD-SIGNED:
  rule: "Every structural bead carries dual PQC+ECDSA signatures."
  enforcement: AIR rejects unsigned beads at ingestion.

INV-BEAD-TEMPORAL:
  rule: "Every structural bead has knowledge_time. Observation beads have world_time."
  enforcement: Schema validation at commit time.

INV-SHADOW-RICH:
  rule: "PROPOSAL_REJECTED is structurally identical to PROPOSAL plus rejection context."
  enforcement: Schema validation rejects lightweight rejection stubs.

INV-ANCHOR-AT-DECISIONS:
  rule: "Merkle anchoring triggers at Decision Boundaries OR fallback caps (500 beads / 1 hour)."
  enforcement: Anchor daemon monitors bead stream for triggers, whichever fires first.

INV-COMMITMENT-THRESHOLD:
  rule: "Only Formal Handoffs become beads. Observation ≠ Incorporation. commit() is the bright line."
  enforcement: Agent contract requires explicit commit() to WORK_TREE to write Structural Bead.

INV-ANCESTRAL-PRESERVED:
  rule: "The 789 extraction-phase CLAIMs (curated from 1178) form a Genesis Snapshot, signed as single Merkle root by G."
  enforcement: Genesis Record is a POLICY bead; all ancestral beads reference its merkle_batch_id.

INV-REFINERY-LATENCY-TRACKED:
  rule: "WT-to-KT delta is a first-class operational metric per bead type."
  enforcement: Dashboard + alerting on latency regression.

INV-NO-ORPHAN-INSIGHTS:
  rule: "All rejected proposals are captured, classified, and routed to Dream Cycle."
  enforcement: Auditor/Risk Engine MUST produce PROPOSAL_REJECTED bead on any rejection.

INV-SOVEREIGN-ANCHOR:
  rule: "Daily ledger root signed with offline HSM key."
  enforcement: Cron job + human verification of anchor.

INV-REJECTION-POLICY-REF:
  rule: "RISK_BREACH rejections MUST reference the active POLICY bead version at time of rejection."
  enforcement: Schema validation rejects RISK_BREACH without rejection_policy_ref.

INV-TEMPORAL-BOUNDING:
  rule: "DERIVED beads inherit WT from OBSERVATION inputs only. PATTERN inputs provide logic, not time."
  enforcement: Schema validation computes DERIVED WT as intersection of OBSERVATION input spans.
```
