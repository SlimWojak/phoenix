# Tester: G
# Hardware: Mac Studio, Apple M4 Max, 64 GB
# Claude Code version: 2.1.27

GT-1_MEMORY_MD:
  status: PASS
  test: "MEMORY.md persists across sessions and auto-loads"
  sub_tests:
    GT-1a:
      status: PASS
      test: "/memory command persists across sessions"
      notes: "Stored in ~/.claude/projects/{path}/memory/"
    GT-1b:
      status: PASS
      test: "State embedded in CLAUDE.md loads at session start"
    GT-1c:
      status: PASS
      test: "CLAUDE.md standing order 'read CHECKPOINT.yaml' — agent follows on startup"
  result: "All 3 sub-tests passed"
  fallback_needed: false

GT-2_RESUME:
  status: PASS
  test: "--resume SESSION_ID restores prior context"
  result: "--resume [UUID] works. UUID found in ~/.claude/projects/{path}/*.jsonl filenames."
  notes: "/memory is project-global (available across ALL sessions, not just resumed one)"
  fallback_needed: false

GT-3_MCP_MEMORY_KEEPER:
  status: SKIPPED
  test: "mcp-memory-keeper installs and Claude Code can use it"
  result: "Installed but not tested in session"
  notes: "/memory native mechanism may be sufficient"
  fallback_needed: false

GT-4_HOOKS:
  status: PASS
  test: "on-session-end hook fires and writes file on exit"
  result: "SessionEnd hook fires successfully"
  notes: "Config location: <project>/.claude/settings.local.json. Hook receives JSON on stdin with session_id, reason, transcript_path. Session ID captured automatically."
  fallback_needed: false

GT-5_HEADLESS:
  status: PASS
  test: "Claude Code runs in headless mode"
  result: "claude -p 'prompt' --allowedTools 'Bash,Write' runs headless. DEXTER 24/7 mode confirmed."
  notes: "Flag is -p (not --headless)"
  fallback_needed: false

GT-6_SUBAGENTS:
  status: PASS
  test: "Opus spawns native subagent that returns result"
  result: "Task() tool delegates to native subagent. Subagent completes independently and returns result."
  fallback_needed: false

SUMMARY:
  total: 6
  passed: 6
  failed: 0
  skipped: 1
  must_pass_met: true
  design_discoveries:
    - "MEMORY.md is NOT auto-loaded (BOAR source was wrong)"
    - "/memory command is the real native persistence mechanism"
    - "SessionEnd hook provides session_id (enables auto-checkpoint with --resume)"
    - "Headless mode is -p flag (not --headless)"
    - "Subagents use Task() tool (not /delegate)"
    - "Hooks config: .claude/settings.local.json (project-level, gitignored)"
    - "CLAUDE.md is reliably loaded as project instructions every session"
