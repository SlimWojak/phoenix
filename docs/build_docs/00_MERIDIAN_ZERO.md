## Gate Summary

**Prime Directive:**  
Amplify elite human trading judgment, not replace it. Move faster than human where machines are superior. Remain wiser than machine where humans must decide. Never blur the boundary between insight and capital.

**The Rule:**  
Machines work. Humans decide. Intelligence is stratified by risk, not constrained uniformly.

**The Test:**  
Would I be comfortable explaining this system, under stress, to my family, after a loss?

**The Trade-off:**  
Clarity over speed. Trust over throughput. Survivability over cleverness.

# Section 1 — Why Meridian Exists

## 1.1 Purpose

Meridian enables **high-quality discretionary ICT trading** with **significant personal capital** in a way that is intellectually honest, operationally disciplined, and capable of compounding edge over time.

This is not a system that trades for you. This is a system that trades *with* you — amplifying your judgment, accelerating your learning, and protecting your capital from the failure modes that kill most traders: under-instrumentation, over-automation, and misplaced authority.

## 1.2 The Operator

Meridian is built for a specific operator profile:

- A skilled discretionary trader developing mastery of ICT methodology
- Technically capable but preferring intuitive tools over deep implementation
- Excited by AI/human collaboration possibilities
- Building for long-term capital compounding, not high-frequency extraction

If you're optimizing for sub-second execution, opaque signal processing, or fully autonomous trading — Meridian is not for you. Those strategies require patterns that conflict with human authority and explainability.

Meridian is designed for people who want machines to do superhuman work while humans retain superhuman judgment.

## 1.3 The Core Problem

Trading systems fail for three reasons:

1. **Under-instrumentation** — Learning is slow, feedback is anecdotal, errors repeat quietly
2. **Over-automation** — Systems become opaque, trust erodes, capital is exposed to logic no human fully understands  
3. **Misplaced authority** — Machines decide what humans should only evaluate

Meridian resolves all three through **stratified intelligence** — not all AI outputs carry the same risk, therefore not all should be constrained equally.

# Section 2 — The Calculated Ambition Philosophy

## 2.1 The Evolution

Traditional "safety-first" AI design constrains intelligence at the point of generation. Every output is hedged, neutral, evidence-bound. The result: suppressed usefulness, blocked proactive discovery, cognitive load pushed back onto the human.

Meridian takes a different stance:

**Constrain at the decision boundary, not at the point of ideation.**

This means:
- Exploration can be unbounded, speculative, creative
- Scrutiny can be brutal, hostile, deterministic  
- The human boundary is sovereign and non-negotiable
- Execution is boring, mechanical, and absolutely safe

The insight: intelligence should be **stratified by output risk**, not constrained uniformly.

## 2.2 Stratified Intelligence

| Layer | Constraint Level | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Exploration** | Unbounded | Creative discovery has no capital risk |
| **Scrutiny** | Brutal | Filter quality determines what reaches human |
| **Human Boundary** | Sovereign | Single point of authority — non-negotiable |
| **Execution** | Deterministic | Capital safety is a mechanical guarantee |

Each layer serves a different function. Constraining exploration like execution would cripple discovery. Liberating execution like exploration would destroy trust.

## 2.3 What This Enables

**Claude can be genuinely useful:**
- Rank setups and express opinions (clearly labeled as such)
- Suggest exploration threads proactively within human-set scope
- Surface patterns and anomalies without waiting to be asked
- Be wrong sometimes — in Exploration, that's a feature, not a bug

**Automation becomes possible:**
- Forensically validated strategies can execute without per-trade approval
- Human pre-authorizes the logic, not each individual trade
- Drift detection monitors for decay and pauses (not adjusts) on violation
- Mechanical execution of validated rules, not "AI trading"

**Capital remains protected:**
- Human authority over capital decisions is absolute
- Exploration cannot touch execution directly
- Every decision at the boundary is evidence-bound
- Override is always available, always simple

## 2.4 The Asymmetric Delegation Rule

**Humans are responsible for:**
- Market interpretation and context judgment
- Strategy definition and risk acceptance  
- Capital commitment and exposure decisions
- System evolution and governance

**Machines are responsible for:**
- Running experiments at superhuman scale
- Enumerating variants humans would never find
- Detecting drift and anomalies tirelessly
- Producing evidence and artifacts for human review

Machines may recommend. Only humans may decide. But machines should recommend *well* — with conviction, with evidence, with opinion.

# Section 3 — The Funnel

## 3.1 One-Way Flow

Meridian is not three separate systems. It's a single funnel where ideas flow one direction: from exploration to execution, with increasing certainty and accountability at each stage.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │         EXPLORATION (Layer A)               │
    │  Unbounded. Speculative. Parallel. Curious. │
    │  Allowed to be wrong. Allowed to speculate. │
    └─────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘

                    [Explicit Approval]
                          ↓
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │         EXECUTION (Layer E)                 │
    │  Deterministic. Replayable. Boring.         │
    │  Enforces what human decided. No judgment.  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Each transition reduces degrees of freedom, increases certainty, increases accountability.**

## 3.2 The Layers

### Exploration (A)

**Purpose:** Generate novel ideas, patterns, and edges that humans would never find alone.

Exploration is where machines work most aggressively. It runs experiments, enumerates possibilities, detects anomalies, and surfaces insights. It operates within human-set scope but proactively within that scope.

Exploration is allowed to be wrong. It's allowed to contradict itself. It's allowed to generate low-quality ideas alongside brilliant ones. This is the point — exploration optimizes for discovery, not accuracy.

**Outputs:** Raw ideas, pattern observations, anomaly flags, exploration threads  
**Not outputs:** Decisions, recommendations for immediate action, anything implying "trade this now"

### Scrutiny (B)

**Purpose:** Kill bad ideas before they waste human attention.

Scrutiny is a hostile filter. Its job is not to promote ideas but to destroy them. Backtests, stress-tests, regime analysis, robustness checks — anything that survives Scrutiny has earned the right to human attention.

Scrutiny produces Decision Artifacts: evidence packages that include what was tested, what passed, what failed, what was excluded and why. Evidence-bound requirements apply here — no black boxes, no unexplained confidence scores.

**Outputs:** Decision Artifacts (structured evidence that survived the gauntlet)  
**Not outputs:** Decisions — Scrutiny produces evidence, not authority

### Human Boundary

**Purpose:** The single, explicit point where authority is exercised.

This is where humans interpret meaning, judge context, decide relevance, and accept risk. Nothing crosses this boundary without deliberate human acceptance.

The human must always see:
- What options exist
- What Scrutiny filtered out (and why)
- What assumptions underlie the artifacts
- What happens if they do nothing

No urgency pressure. No single-option framing. No implied decisions through presentation.

### Execution (E)

**Purpose:** Safely manage capital through deterministic logic.

Execution is minimal, boring, and replayable. It executes only human-authorized actions. It enforces pre-approved constraints. It does not learn, interpret, or optimize.

For validated strategies, Execution can automate entry/exit — but this is mechanical execution of human-authored rules, not AI trading. Human pre-authorizes the logic; drift detection monitors for decay.

Protective mechanisms (stop-loss, position limits, loss locks) execute without hesitation, emotion, or delay. This is enforcement of human decisions, not machine initiative.

## 3.3 Forbidden Paths

Some paths simply don't exist:

- **Exploration → Execution:** Raw ideas cannot touch capital
- **Exploration → Human without Scrutiny:** Unvetted ideas don't reach decisions  
- **Scrutiny → Execution:** Evidence cannot execute itself — only human approval crosses
- **Execution → Exploration (feedback):** No implicit learning loops

The funnel flows one direction. Authority lives in one place. Capital protection is mechanical.

# Section 4 — Trust Through Structure

## 4.1 Capital Safety as Psychology

Meridian manages significant personal capital. At any moment, the operator must be able to answer:

- Why are we in this position?
- What assumptions does it rely on?
- What evidence supported entering?
- What risks were accepted?
- What would cause exit?
- What happens if no action is taken?

If any question cannot be answered clearly, the system has failed — regardless of profit.

## 4.2 Explainability Under Stress

During drawdowns, dislocations, and emotional pressure:
- The system simplifies, not obscures
- Critical facts surface first
- Override is obvious and tested
- The operator can explain decisions to their family

Complex explanations that only work in calm conditions are worthless.

## 4.3 Learning Without Black Boxes

Learning exists to improve human decision quality, not to automate decisions.

Every learning step traces to a human-posed question, a defined experiment, and inspectable evidence. There is no implicit intelligence. Models will hallucinate, regress, be confidently wrong. Meridian assumes this.

Evidence must be grounded. Conclusions must be traceable. Memory is not truth — only state, events, artifacts, and decisions are authoritative.

## 4.4 Replay Capability

Any past moment can be reconstructed:
- What state existed
- What events occurred  
- What artifacts were available
- What the human decided

Replay is not optional. It's how Meridian learns without rewriting history. If it cannot be replayed, it cannot be trusted.

# Section 5 — Claude's Role

## 5.1 Where Claude Lives

Claude operates primarily in Exploration and Scrutiny. Claude is a powerful collaborator in generating ideas and producing evidence.

Claude does not:
- Approve its own outputs
- Cross the human boundary without explicit acceptance
- Execute trades or affect capital
- Make decisions of any kind

## 5.2 Claude's Voice

**In Exploration:** Highly opinionated, speculative, creative. Claude can say "I think this pattern is interesting because..." and "My read is that this setup looks strong."

**In Scrutiny:** Neutral, evidence-focused, skeptical. Claude presents artifacts with explicit methodology, limitations, and exclusions.

**At Human Boundary:** Presents artifacts clearly, offers interpretation when asked, but does not pressure. Claude can say "Based on the evidence, this looks like an A-grade setup to me because [reasons]. The main risk I see is [risk]. What's your read?"

**Claude should not say:** "You should take this trade" or "Act now before the opportunity passes."

The distinction is constitutional.

## 5.3 Proactive Within Scope

Claude can suggest exploration threads proactively within human-set scope. If the human says "Investigate EUR/USD setups during London session," Claude doesn't wait for specific questions — Claude explores, generates hypotheses, surfaces anomalies.

This is not autonomous action. This is aggressive work within bounded authority.

# Section 6 — What Meridian Is Not

**Meridian is not:**
- Fully autonomous trading
- Machine-defined strategy
- Implicit learning loops
- Speed at the expense of clarity
- A black box that happens to be profitable

**Meridian intentionally trades:**
- Speed for clarity
- Throughput for trust  
- Cleverness for survivability
- High-frequency opportunity for explainability

Missed opportunities due to human checkpoint are an accepted and intentional consequence. If this trade-off is unacceptable, Meridian is the wrong system.

# Section 7 — The Amendment Rule

This document is Layer 1 — immutable law. It may not be reinterpreted, softened, or bypassed for convenience.

Amendment requires:
1. Clear problem identified in writing
2. Explicit proposed change  
3. Impact on capital safety assessed
4. Reviewed under calm conditions
5. Never amended under pressure

All subordinate documents (Architecture, Build Plan, Playbooks) must comply with this philosophy. When in conflict, this document prevails.

---

# Section 8 — Closing Commitment

By adopting Meridian Zero, the operator commits to:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Authority over automation  
- Explainability over speed
- Survivability over optimization

This commitment is binding regardless of market conditions or performance pressure.

**Meridian exists to serve human judgment, not to replace it.**

**If Meridian ever asks for trust without understanding, it has failed.**
