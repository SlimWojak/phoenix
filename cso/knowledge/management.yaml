# DRAWER 5: MANAGEMENT — "How to manage the trade?"
# VERSION: DRAFT v0
# PURPOSE: Targets, stops, adjustments
# RULE: Answers "What do I do after entry?"

schema_version: "1.0.0"
created: "2026-01-23"
label: "DRAFT v0 — 5-drawer extraction, pending Olya validation"

# =============================================================================
# NOTE: MANAGEMENT IS THIN IN SOURCES
# =============================================================================
# LAYER_0 doc focuses on context/conditions, not trade management
# NEX MMM has basic phase logic but limited management detail
# This drawer flags gaps for Olya validation
