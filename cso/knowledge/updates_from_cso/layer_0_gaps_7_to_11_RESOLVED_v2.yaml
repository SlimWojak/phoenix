# GAP 10 & 11: NOT LAYER 0 GAPS ℹ️
# =============================================================================

gap_10_11_clarification:
  status: "NOT LAYER 0 GAPS"
  
  explanation:
    "GAP 10 (Risk Removal) and GAP 11 (Session Filters) are D15MB strategy-specific gaps.
    They belong to D15MB Layers 2-3 (Operating Range + Execution), NOT Layer 0 (HTF Context).
    
    Layer 0 provides environment. D15MB strategy uses that environment.
    
    GAP 10 and 11 will be resolved when building D15MB strategy layers."
